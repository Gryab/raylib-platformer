An attempt at creating a simple platformer-type game, design and mechanics are improvised, development in progress. Using raylib (github.com/raysan5/raylib) for graphics, some of the collisions and user input

To build follow the instructions from (github.com/raysan5/raylib-game-template) and add the ***contents*** "raylib-platformer" directory at the "projects/VS2022" path. Open "raylib_todo.sln" as project (Works with VS2022 on my machine, nothing is guaranteed). 

None of the code from raylib-game-template was used, though
