An attempt at creating a simple platformer-type game, design and mechanics are improvised, development in progress. Using raylib (github.com/raysan5/raylib) for graphics, some of the collisions and user input

To build follow the instructions from (github.com/raysan5/raylib-game-template) and replace the "raylib-game-template" directory with "raylib-platformer" directory.(Works with VS2022 on my machine, nothing is guaranteed). 

None of the code from raylib-game-template was used, though
